import UIKit

// Arithmetic Operators

// Operators are mathematical symbols like "+" & "-". Swift has a huge range of them.
// Performing operations on an int with a double = 2.5 * 2 produces a double.

// Constants to use for different operations.
let firstValue = 9
let secondValue = 10

// Addition & Subtraction
let total = firstValue + secondValue
let difference = secondValue - firstValue

// Multiplication and Division
let product = firstValue * secondValue
let dividedResult = secondValue / firstValue

// Modulus/Remainder
let thirdValue = 4
let remainder = secondValue % thirdValue
