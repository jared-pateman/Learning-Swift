# Learning-Swift
Repository for Swift playgrounds used to learn about swift. Topics Covered come from the app: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/unwrap/id1440611372

This is my first repository used for Swift code. Using this as a way to learn basics of Swift before writing an app. Most of the code is mimicked but not 100% copied from the linked app. In some cases the linked app has been copied, when I have been unable to think of something different.
